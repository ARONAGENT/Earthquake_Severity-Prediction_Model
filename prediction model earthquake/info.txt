Earthquake Severity Prediction Model
===================================

1. Purpose:
This machine learning model predicts the "Severity Normalized" of earthquake impacts in Nepal based on key factors like hazard intensity, exposure, housing conditions, poverty levels, and vulnerability.

2. Input Features:
- Hazard (Intensity): Seismic hazard level
- Exposure: Population/assets at risk
- Housing: Structural vulnerability
- Poverty: Socioeconomic status
- Vulnerability: Combined risk factors

3. Output:
- Predicted Severity Normalized (0-1 scale where higher values indicate more severe impacts)

4. Model Type:
- Multiple Linear Regression (supervised learning)

5. Key Metrics:
- R² Score: Measures goodness of fit (1 = perfect prediction)
- RMSE: Average prediction error magnitude
- MAE: Mean absolute error

6. Applications:
- Disaster preparedness planning
- Resource allocation for relief efforts
- Risk assessment for infrastructure projects

7. Limitations:
- Assumes linear relationships between features
- Accuracy depends on data quality
- Doesn't account for unseen catastrophic events

Model developed using Python scikit-learn.
